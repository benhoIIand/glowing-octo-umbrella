Lyst Code Test - Ben Holland
============================

Hi ðŸ‘‹ I've completed the code test. Follow the instructions below to run the program.

## Instructions

1. Install NodeJS and npm from here - https://nodejs.org/en/ (>=8)
2. Open a terminal window at the root of this project
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run the command with your input parameters, i.e. `node run.js 16:10 < config.txt`

## Caveats
I've followed the instructions in the document regarding the formatting of 24 hour times. So 1am will be formatted as `1:00`. I'm not sure if this is a mistake in the test instructions and it should actually be `01:00`. Either way, I've followed the documentation.
